# Market Requirements Document (MRD)
**Product:** Houlnd Realty

## 1. Executive Summary
The real estate market is currently characterized by high intermediation costs, a lack of trust due to fraudulent listings, and inefficient price discovery mechanisms. Houlnd Realty aims to capitalize on the market shift toward direct "Zero Brokerage" interactions by addressing the specific gap of **granular price transparency** and **verified lead generation**.

## 2. Market Problem (The "Why")
The market faces four distinct failures that Houlnd addresses:

*   **The Cost Barrier (Brokerage Fees):** Both buyers and sellers are burdened by intermediaries charging commissions up to 20%, often for minimal value addition.
*   **The Trust Deficit (Fake & Litigated Listings):** Existing platforms are saturated with fake listings created for lead generation and properties under litigation. Buyers fundamentally lack faith in the authenticity of online listings.
*   **Information Asymmetry (Price Discovery):** Buyers struggle to compare value across different property types (e.g., plots vs. apartments) because existing platforms lack standardized "Price per Sq.ft" filtering. This makes it difficult to assess fair market value.
*   **Lead Quality & Privacy:** Sellers (Promoters) are reluctant to list online due to fear of spam calls and unqualified leads. They lack a mechanism to filter for high-intent buyers without hiring a broker.

## 3. Target Audience (The "Who")
### A. The Customer (Buyer)
*   **Profile:** Individuals looking for residential investments (plots, apartments, villas).
*   **Current Behavior:** Using legacy platforms (MagicBricks, 99acres) but frustrated by "contact agent" barriers and lack of clear pricing data.
*   **Emerging Needs:** High demand for "low-density housing" (villas, plotted developments) and homeownership in suburban/Tier 2 cities.
*   **Critical Requirement:** Needs to filter specifically by **Sq.ft Price (e.g., 999 to 19999)** to determine affordability and value instantly.

### B. The Promoter (Seller)
*   **Profile:** Property owners looking to liquidate assets.
*   **Pain Point:** Wants to sell without paying upfront fees but is willing to pay a commission *upon success*.
*   **Critical Requirement:** Demands privacy; their phone number must not be disclosed until a buyer proves intent by paying to "unlock" the contact.

## 4. Market Trends & Strategic Context
*   **The Shift to "Digital-First":** The industry is moving toward "technology-first organizations." AI and data analytics are becoming standard for property search and visualization.
*   **PropTech Disruption:** The market has validated the "Zero Brokerage" model (e.g., NoBroker), proving that users prefer direct connection over intermediation.
*   **Preference for Transparency:** There is a macro-trend toward "decarbonisation" and "demographics" where buyers demand transparency in all aspects, including legal standing and sustainability. Houlnd’s strict "Verified Only" policy aligns with this demand for safety.

## 5. Competitive Landscape
The market is divided into two primary segments:

*   **Legacy Listing Platforms (e.g., MagicBricks, 99acres):**
    *   *Weakness:* Often "stuck" in broker-centric models where agents spam listings to capture leads.
    *   *Gap:* Lack strict verification against litigated properties and often fail to offer precise unit-price filtering.
*   **Zero-Brokerage Disruptors (e.g., NoBroker):**
    *   *Strength:* Eliminated the middleman.
    *   *Houlnd’s Differentiation:* Houlnd goes a step further by **monetizing the contact unlock** (Gated Access) rather than just a subscription, and by focusing heavily on the **Sq.ft Price** filter as the primary search utility.

## 6. Market Opportunity
*   **Monetization of Trust:** Users are increasingly willing to pay for *verified* data. By gating seller contact info behind a payment, Houlnd monetizes the "high intent" of the buyer, creating a revenue stream that relies on lead quality rather than volume.
*   **Niche Precision:** While competitors offer broad searches, Houlnd captures the segment of serious investors who calculate value based on square footage price points, simplifying the decision process for diverse assets like land vs. built-up areas.

## 7. Success Requirements
To succeed in this market, the solution must deliver:
1.  **Absolute Data Integrity:** 0% fake or litigated postings. If trust is broken, the "Gated Access" model fails.
2.  **Hyper-Specific Filtering:** The "Sq.ft Price" filter is the "main point" for the Customer App and must be the central user experience.
3.  **Privacy Assurance:** The seller's contact details must be technically secured and never exposed without a payment event.
